# Playwright Test Automation Framework

This repository contains a Playwright-based test automation framework for web application testing, specifically targeting the LinkedIn login functionality as an example.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your test environment set up and run the tests.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    This will install Playwright, `dotenv`, and other necessary packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    Playwright needs to download the browser binaries it controls.
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project (where `playwright.config.js` is located), create a file named `.env`. This file will store sensitive credentials and user-specific data, and **should not be committed to version control**.

    Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual LinkedIn credentials and expected logged-in user name:

    ```
    # .env
    LINKEDIN_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
    LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
    LINKEDIN_LOGGEDINUSER=Your Name On LinkedIn
    ```

    **Important:** Make sure `Your Name On LinkedIn` exactly matches the display name you expect after logging in (e.g., "Nagaraja Gaddale").

2.  **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:**
    To prevent sensitive data from being accidentally committed, ensure your `.gitignore` file includes the `.env` entry:

    ```
    # .gitignore
    .env
    node_modules/
    test-results/
    playwright-report/
    # ... other ignored files/folders
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Tests

All tests are configured via `playwright.config.js` and can be run using the Playwright CLI.

### Run all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```
